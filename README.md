# Onboarding Refresher

The purpose of this notebook is to make sure you have the R skills you'll need in the lab fresh on your mind. You may be able to answer some of the questions with code you've written before. For other questions, you may need to do some research on the problem, or ask for help. Both solutions are totally fine as long as, at the end, you feel comfortable with the coding concepts needed to answer the question.

### To get started.

1. Log in to your GitHub account. Then fork this repository.
2. Open RStudio and create a new project by choosing Version Control -> Git and then entering in the URL for your forked version of the repo. Put it in a location you can find. A better plan? [Install Box Drive](https://www.box.com/resources/downloads/drive), create a folder called the RoperLab and put everything you do in there. That'll mean your code is backed up on both GitHub and Box. You'll lose nothing, even in the most catastrophic computer failure.
3. Once you're set up, answer the questions in the `r_review.Rmd` notebook.
4. When you're done, go to the Git tab in R Studio, click commit, write a message to yourself what this commit represents in the commit message box and hit commit. After that runs, click Push.
5. Then, send the URL of your forked repo to the Roper Lab channel in Slack.
